# GoalPost-App
A Coursera-Project, simple iOS App with the basics of working with Core Data in iOS.

Having data to present in apps is important. But it can be equally important to know how to persist the data to a phone even after the app is closed. 

In this module, I learned how to use Core Data to build more robust, data-driven applications.

Learning Objectives

    How to model data for Core Data
    How to create database relationships
    How to persist data
