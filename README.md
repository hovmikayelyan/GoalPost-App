# GoalPost-App
A Coursera-Project, simple iOS App with the basics of working with Core Data in iOS.

Having data to present in apps is important. But it can be equally important to know how to persist the data to a phone even after the app is closed. 

In this module I've learnt how to use Core Data to build more robust, data-driven applications.
