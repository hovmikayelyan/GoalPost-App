# GoalPost-App
A Coursera-Project, simple iOS App with the basics of working with Core Data in iOS.

GoalPost is a goal-setting and goal management app. You can create SMART (short term and long term) goals. You can also keep track of habits with daily check marks and goal journal features.

Having data to present in apps is important. But it can be equally important to know how to persist the data to a phone even after the app is closed. 

In this module, I learned how to use Core Data to build more robust, data-driven applications.
